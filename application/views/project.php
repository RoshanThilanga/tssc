                                                        Currently, a standard for solid bio fuel is under development. This will look into the consistency in the quality of fuel, better coordination between industry and production and improved compatibility.<br>

                                                        A database for information exchange among the relevant stakeholders is in the final stages of development. The database is designed to improve coordination between the supply and end use industry and also bring the current informal biomass energy chain to a formal status. It is anticipated that the database will be populated by engaging relevant industries.
