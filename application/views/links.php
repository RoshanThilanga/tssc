                                        <p>The Bio-Energy Association of Sri Lanka (BEASL) was formed by a group of concerned citizens who have long strived to promote the use of indigenous resources for power generation and thus reduce the increasing dependence on imported fossil fuels for both generation of electricity and thermal energy requirements. In the backdrop of power shortages in the past years and the looming threat of further shortages and the escalation of costs of energy, the value of Biomass energy is at last being realized and has received the attention of the government authorities. In order to offer well considered opinions and advice for the formulation of necessary policies and plans BEASL has been incorporated as an association under the Companies Act.
