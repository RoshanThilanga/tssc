The province is divided into two distinct geographic areas: Jaffna peninsula and the Vanni. Jaffna peninsula is irrigated by underground aquifers fed by wells whereas the Vanni has irrigation tanks fed by perennial rivers.
It is endowed with plethora of natural resources with high potential for development in several areas including commercialized agriculture, livestock and fisheries. Availability of a commercial harbor in Kankasanturei and connected network of transportation by land and air via Palai airport provide enormous opportunities for the harnessing of potential for related development projects.
It has a total land area of 8,884 sq.km which includes 594 sq. km. of water bodies. Water bodies include the lagoons, bays, freshwater tanks and streams in the area. With regard to land utilization, the province has 167,368 Ha of cultivable land (19 % of the land area of the province). The coastal line is 594 km.

In Northern Province, inland fishing contributes 3% of national inland fish production while marine fishing contributes 13%. 
Note: Marine fisheries data should have to be obtained from Ministry of fisheries and aquatic resources development. The above Statistical data is obtained by calculation from some information we got from the Regional office of Fisheries department and related websites. In the case of Inland Fisheries, the statistical data is officially published by NAQDA (National Authority for Aquaculture Development) that belongs to Ministry of Fisheries and Aquatic Resources Development.
