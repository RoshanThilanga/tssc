It is designed to address the lack of confidence in both supply (fuel wood production/ sourcing biomass) and demand (industrial needs) sectors by raising awareness, developing standards and sustainable fuel wood certification schemes, demonstrating viability of plantations through a livelihood-based approach with a broader scope for its application and implementation at the national level.</li>

The Ministry of Power and Energy (MOPE) itself, realizing the dire need for sustainable and viable fuelwood suppliers (exchanges) has initiated a plan to establish fuelwood depots with the participation of non-governmental or private sector entities, supported by technology providers and banks. The expected outcome from this component is increased number of investment projects from commercial banks, and increased the confidence in the industrial sector on the longer term sustainability of supply.</li>

GEF resources will be used to finance incremental activities that would ensure the effective implementation of bioenergy technologies  (BETs) such as technical and financial feasibility analysis, and monitoring of operation and performance of the installed demonstration projects etc. Such pilots are intended to demonstrate to the government and the private sector (particularly in the energy, industry, and banking/financial sectors), the techno-economic viability and benefits of BETs, especially modern technologies with high efficiency. The demonstrations will be carried out to showcase the planning, design, engineering, financing, and installation, operation, maintenance and performance evaluation of a range of BETs (gasification, combustion and energy-efficiency improvements in biomass-fired boilers, furnaces dryers and kilns).</li>
